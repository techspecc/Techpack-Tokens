## FWB SEASON FOUR
Tokenizing product creation research powered by FWB season 4 collection desinged by young shooter angelofuture#0664

Testing out different ways to point royalties and prove provenence of design work through blockchain communities.

# NOTES
1; Use blockheight as "time" provenence for the artwork, so in 100 yeats we can see if/when an artwork was created. And re-use the designs.

2; Token information is SHA 256 encoded

 "FWB SEASON 4 BIRD TSHIRT WHITE" is gonna looks like:
 "F30A2B9E44999DA5BA0610785180A067D33763DD3B7D68FADCA9C43D59AE7939"

 Just for aesthetic reasons, cleaner more universal and timeless.

 3; Wondering is we can include "clothing" attributes to the techpack token URIs so it can be called from the contract. 

Type: Hooded Sweatshirt
Body Color: Black
I dunno, might be overthinking it

Although we love on chain-ness figured it's easier and lighter to use PNGs for most artworks. Might keep the simpler logos as SVGs ideally since you can call the SVG string which strenghtens the idea of collective creation.
